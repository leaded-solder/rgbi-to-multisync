# NEC MultiSync MDA/CGA/EGA/Japanese DIN RGBI adapter
This adapter is meant to help support multiple old computers when used with the NEC MultiSync line of CRTs.

It has only been tested on the MultiSync 3D. Earlier models may require a different adapter; please check your service manual.

# Current Status
**NOT WORKING** - the MultiSync does not wake up under Japanese RGBI input from either a PC-6601SR or PC-9801UV2.
